We plan to achieve this goal using a holistic approach that includes ambitious targets for all stages of automotive value creation — from the supply chain to production, the vehicle use phase, and vehicle disposal and recycling. We plan to offer our customers several electric variants in all Mercedes-Benz car segments (from the smart to large SUVs) by 2022 and to have plug-in hybrids or all-electric vehicles account for more than 50% of our car sales by 2030. By 2030, we also plan to reduce the green- house gas emissions of the new vehicle fleet during the vehicle use phase (“well-to-wheel”) by more than 40% as compared to 2018.
